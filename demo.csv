Subject: SAP Financials Data Warehouse Update 07/18/2000


Below is an update on the SAP-Financials Data Warehouse Project.  Information 
has been divided into five areas: Infrastructure, Software, Rapid Mart 
Configuration, 'People' involved with project, and Training.  

Each area has a status color associated with it indicating how the project is 
done in terms of schedule.  RED represents trouble areas we are addressing, 
YELLOW represents potential slippage we are addressing and Green is for items 
""in good shape"".  I am preparing an MS Project file and will publish it later 
this week to illustrate timelines in a graphical format.


I. INFRASTRUCTURE ACQUISITION and PREPARATION: RED

ACTA Application Server (UNIX):  Configured and being tested. 
ACTA Database Server (UNIX):  Received 7/7/2000.  O/S being added, internal 
drives on order (due 7/19), adding of Oracle DB Software will follow.  Target 
date to start Acta install and configuration is 7/26/2000.  
UNIX Database Storage: On order, due 8/9, estimated ready date 8/17.  Sense 
Corp. agrees that we can install and configure ACTA using internal drives 
until Storage arrives.  Not as critical to delivery date since initial Rapid 
Mart configuration can proceed using extra internal storage drives added to 
DB server (item 2 above).  Storage to be ready for install mid-August.
BRIO Broadcast Report and On-Demand Query Application Server (UNIX):  Ordered 
from SUN vendor 7/11/2000. 
Intranet WEB Server (UNIX):  Ordered from SUN vendor 7/11/2000.
Connectivity:  System Requirements forwarded to all technical contacts 
(7/18).  Meeting Thursday (7/20) with all technical groups and Sense Corp. 
consultant to cover ACTA System Requirements Document and ensure everyone 
understands details and can deliver on or before 7/26 target date.
The hardware mentioned in items 1 - 5 above make-up the DEV/QA environment 
for the SAP-Financials Data Warehouse.  The UNIX Infrastructure group 
recommendation is still to hold off ordering the Production environment 
machines.  Two reasons were cited:  
Wait so the performance of the DEV/QA boxes can be tested and determine if 
models originally identified for Production will be sufficient.
Wait to get feedback from customer groups on the value of the Data Warehouse 
deliverable and concept.  Frequently, Data Warehouses catch on quickly with 
the user community and they push to include much more information (in our 
case non-SAP data) into the data warehouse than originally anticipated.  


II. SOFTWARE ACQUISITION:  Green

ACTA software is purchased, in-house and paid for - installation awaits 
database server.
Confirmed that additional funds will not be needed for Oracle database 
software.  Meeting with GSS rep. Laine Borgman, Oracle rep. and NET WORKS 
contact Bob McAuliffe Monday 7/17 confirmed Enron has an enterprise license 
for the Oracle DB package.
BRIO Reporting and Querying software is in-house as free trial license 
through 7/31/00.  Tool has been selected by Enron Company business and IT 
group and is final stages of purchase process.  Target completion date is 
this Wednesday (7/19).  
Initial meeting on BRIO Training Wednesday (7/19) with Tennyson Group.  
Information and issues will be taken to initial Reporting Council meeting 
(7/27).


III. RAPID MART CONFIGURATION (Phase One of Project): YELLOW

ACTA consulting Partner, Sense Corp., is lined up to install ACTA and 
configuration of Rapid Marts.  Their paperwork for IT, HR and A/P is 
currently being completed.  
Received and reviewed Sense Corp. project plan and resource rates.  Project's 
budget can pay for Project Mgr. and two Acta Extraction Developers during 
Phases One and  Two, based on savings experienced on reporting and querying 
tool. 
Schedule is 2-3 weeks per Rapid Mart, if architecture, security and IDs are 
completely prepared prior to Sense Corp. arrival.  This makes best case 
scenario of first Rapid Mart delivery 8/9 -8/16.


IV. PEOPLE: YELLOW

Reporting Council representatives:
Requested in July 7th email to CAOs and cc: to SAP Site Managers.  
12 reps. have been named to-date.  
Kickoff meeting for all members scheduled for 7/27.  Agenda to include 
overview of council role, project objectives, obtain council member's 
recommendations for the process of report identification, prioritization and 
feedback to developers on finished product (feedback loop).
Technical contacts:  
Obtained contacts for all groups UNIX Infrastructure (Mike Barber and Gary 
Law), DBAs (Douglas Cummins), Networking (Keith Dziadek), SAP Technical - 
Database and ABAP (Tracy Terrell).  
Provided each with written System Requirements 7/18/2000.  
Kickoff meeting with Sense Corp. consultant to confirm pre-installation 
checklist on Thursday, July 20th.
SAP Technical Analysts/Developers:
Held meetings with Mark Schmidt and Kathy Kokas regarding SAP/COE resources.
Interviews with recommended resources this week and next.
COE / SAP resources will be charging time to project, whether they are Enron 
employees or contractors.  This was not incorporated in the initial project 
budget and may cause the project to go over budget.  (Specifics will follow 
once resources are confirmed and their rates identified).    
Reporting and Querying Tool Lead and Developers:
Requested a reporting tool lead and developers from initial project companies 
(GPG has 5-6 EDS Developers who are budgeted for SAP ABAP reports and will 
now take BRIO Training. 3-4 additional resources are being requested through 
EES IT Outsourcing Deal to IBM with no additional cost to ENRON or project.  


V. TRAINING:  Green

ACTA TRAINING:
ACTA training will be given for the first 3 days of the ACTA software 
installation.  Up to 8 Enron resources can attend.  This will be scheduled 
shortly, in conjunction with availability of on DEV/QA environment and Acta 
training consultant. Target date 7/26-28.  
Confirm 8 individuals who will support ACTA: Contacts Michael Barber (2?)  
Douglas Cummins (2?) Operations (?) SAP Technical (3?).  
BRIO REPORTING and QUERYING TOOL:
Training classes for 10 BRIO Support Contacts across Enron are included in 
BRIO contract.  Travel expenses to California training site paid by Enron

initial group of ""client"" and ""server"" users.  Enron pays consultant travel 
expenses to Houston. 
BRIO / Enron contract provides 100 CBT installations which we can loan 
install, uninstall as users need them.  Which group to administrate (NET 
WORKS Global Help Desk)?
Other training can be purchased directly from BRIO or their outsource 
partner, the Tennyson Group.  Meeting with Tennyson Group on Wednesday 7/20 
for training overview, recommendations, issues, etc.  These items will then 
be brought up at the Reporting Council Kickoff Meeting Scheduled for 7/27. ""

Dear Premium Member:

Do you need income now, or will you need it in the near
future? Have you made considerable money and now wish to protect
it? Are you retired?

Answer yes to any one of these questions and you'll want to
learn more about Bonds. And if you haven't looked at bonds in a
while, you're in for a surprise. They've changed. There are more
types, more bond funds, and more volatility.

So, we suggest you make your first bond venture boning up on
bonds. We've made that very easy, and even added a lot of fun to
the process, too! (Not to mention the great rewards you can get.)

Just try our new Investing Classroom Bond track at
http://www.morningstar.com/RD/BondTrack.html?memail=prem

You'll find 20 courses divided into two sections. They take
you from the basics to information about specific types of bonds.
Here's a sampling of the topics you'll master easily and quickly:

Bonds 100:
Bond Market Interest Rates
Bond Duration
Buying Bonds
Immunization
The Process of Issuing Bonds
..plus five more

Bonds 200:
Collateralized Mortgage Obligation
Zero Coupon Securities
TIGRs, CATS, AND LIONs
STRIPS
Treasury Inflation-Adjusted Securities
..plus five more

There's more, too. After each course, you'll reinforce your
knowledge with a short quiz. And you'll get credits for each
question you answer correctly. Our new Bond track gives you the
chance to pick up 100 credits. That's enough for some pretty
handsome rewards.

You can redeem your credits for great Morningstar Rewards.
These include gear like our fleece pullover. Or redeem them for
products like free subscriptions to Morningstar FundInvestor and

Greetings everyone.  I just wanted to thank all of you for coming to the
housewarming party.  It meant a lot that so many of you came from far away
(Seattle and Grants Pass) for me, and helped me welcome in my new home.  I
also wanted to thank those of you were so kind and treated me to present.  I
didn't expect that, but fully loved it.  Thanks again for making it so much
fun.

Oh---I will probably be single by this weekend, so I am thinking we should
party on cinco de Mayo. I am giving Bart the boot. Let me know if something
fun is going on.  Talk to you all soon.

Luvins,
Elizah"

The ISO (K Robb) circulated the ISO's position on the Def Penalties this
PM. It is attached.

As it stands, what the ISO wants now (or previously wanted) is an issue to
be decided by the BIC. What is now proposed - empowering the ISO to change
the deficiency rates if an adjacent ISO modifies (presumably upward) their
caps - has one large problem: if such an action were taken in the midst of
a Capability Period it would cause all sorts of issues with participant
positions.

Having said that I offer the following:

The FERC staff report strongly indicated that caps would have to exist (if
at all) on a regional basis and at similar levels.

In order to de-list and be free to sell out, a generator must make that
decision for the following month by the 10th of the current month. That is
trading a sure ICAP revenue stream for the increased opportunity to sell
energy at higher prices - even if some disaster befell one of out
neighbors, the amount that can move is limited by the transmission
capability.

What is the likelihood that any of the 3 NE ISOs will be uncapped next
Summer?

The transmission system limits how much energy can flow regardless of price
considerations. NY-NE about 1500Mw and NY-PJM about 2000 Mw (pending return
of the PARs).

BME, if faced with a reserve shortage (or inability to meet load), will
curtail exports to solve that problem.

rstalter@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



The following message has been forwarded to the Tech Exchange at the
request of
Steven Keller of the NY PSC:


Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
""optimistic"" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with 
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the 
assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.  He said:

Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell 
Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately 
transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new 
master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher 
Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to 
do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since 
Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but 
we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never 
enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.  

I'll keep you posted when I hear from him."

Volume won't affect relative profitability.  It just scales the profit or 
loss.  Increasing the number of transactions always results in more profit.  
Increasing volume just makes the numbers bigger.

Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric> Deregulation
By James C. Benton, CQ Staff 
At the dawn of the year, it seemed Congress would be content to let the 
current session end without moving legislation to encourage further 
deregulation of the nation's $220 billion <electric> market. But developments 
in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation, 
as well as the Clinton administration, are building a consensus that will put 
pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year.
On April 6, a group called the <Electricity> Restructuring Stakeholders -- 
representing consumers, <electric> generating companies, senior citizens and 
others -- released a set of goals they believe should be included in 
restructuring legislation. The principles include repeal of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (<PUHCA>) and changes to a 1978 law (PL 
95-617) that required state utility commissions and <utilities> to reform 
their <electric> rates and take other measures to even out daily <electric> 
consumption. (1978 CQ Almanac, p. 639)
The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify 
other areas where common ground can be reached, said Joe Nipper, chief 
lobbyist for the American Public Power Association.
A smaller trade group, composed mainly of investor-owned <utilities>, is 
working on its own set of principles.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an 
April 17 speech to the National Energy Marketers Association, and he urged 
Congress to pass an <electric> restructuring bill.
""Our interstate <electricity> markets are in need of repair,"" Richardson 
said, adding that <transmission> access and generation capacity are 
decreasing as demand for <electricity> grows. ""If Congress fails to act -- 
and act soon -- on restructuring legislation, it will strangle the 
development of competitive <electricity> markets.""
The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan 
have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the 106th Congress. But 
they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar, 
election-year politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues 
on how to rewrite or repeal <PUHCA>.
On April 27, Senate Energy Chairman Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, will hold 
the last of three hearings on eight <electric> deregulation-related measures.
On the House side, retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr., 
R-Va., has vowed to work toward enacting a bill (HR 2944) to encourage 
further state deregulation of the <electric> utility market. That measure, 
which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone, not 
just the nearest utility, was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on 
Energy and Power on Oct. 27. (CQ Weekly, p. 478; 1999 CQ Weekly, p. 2599)
The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a 
competitive market but contains no deadline, or ""date certain,"" by which 
states would have to restructure.
Moving a Senate Bill
Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome 
this year. For example, while they have made progress on principles, the key 
negotiators -- representing investor-owned <utilities>; <electric> 
cooperatives; municipal <electric> <utilities>; large <electricity> 
consumers; labor unions, and environmental groups -- still must reach 
consensus on details the legislation should address, as well as the 
legislative language to implement any agreement.
""I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low, not from 
the lack of trying,"" Nipper said.
The best chance appears to lie in the Senate, where Murkowski's committee is 
considering eight bills. ""I am committed to getting something meaningful out 
of my committee,"" Murkowski said in an April 14 interview. Murkowski 
acknowledged, though, that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on 
each of the bills pose challenges to his goal -- developing a comprehensive 
deregulation bill, not one that only addresses portions of <electric> 
restructuring.
The path in the House appears more difficult, although one key supporter said 
there is behind-the-scenes movement.
Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR 2944 before Memorial Day, and he 
has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee.
Joe L. Barton, R-Texas, the sponsor of HR 2944, said meetings are taking 
place among Bliley, Republican House staffers and some interested groups. 
""There is some action; it's just not visible,"" Barton said late last month. 
""I think what's happening there is that [stakeholders are] jockeying for 
position.""
Barton said he anticipated that a ""fairly good bill"" could be moved by the 
middle of May if stakeholders and members come together.
One complication: Democrats, in the midst of the battle to regain control of 
the House, may not move toward a consensus with Republicans. Staff aides for 
several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from 
the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee.
But others point to a 1992 energy law (PL 102-486) that cleared Congress in 
the weeks before that year's election. It contained provisions allowing <
utilities> and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power 
market; that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in 
some markets. So far, 25 states and the District of Columbia have either 
restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in 
coming years. (1992 Almanac, p. 231)
Mark Stultz, a spokesman for the <Electric> <Power> Supply Association, a 
group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers, said the 1992 law 
was enacted after the <electric> industry quickly built up a consensus among 
members and educated them on what the bill would do.
""The industry was able to access that in a very short time,"" Stultz said. As 
far as getting a restructuring bill through this year, Stultz said it is ""not 
an impossible, unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus,"" 
since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues. They include 
blocking ""market power"" -- the ability of a few companies to stunt 
competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated 
market to its advantage.
While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with, Stultz 
said it also contains some fatal flaws. He cited as an example its lack of 
federal agency jurisdiction over ""bundled"" services in a regulated market, in 
which <electric> generation, <transmission> and distribution rates are 
combined in an <electric> bill, and ""unbundled"" services in a deregulated 
market, in which the generation rates are broken apart from <transmission> 
and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation 
are included.
Best Bets in the Senate
Of the eight bills pending in the Senate, Nipper said the one with the best 
chance of passing is S 2071, sponsored by Slade Gorton, R-Wash., which is 
intended to encourage greater <electric> <reliability>. Nipper said the 
Gorton bill would replace the North American <Electric> <Reliability> 
Council, a group in which utility participation is voluntary, with the <
Electric> <Reliability> Organization, a board that would require 
participation by <utilities>. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would 
have jurisdiction over the board, as well as the power to enforce its 
policies on <utilities>.
The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months, due to 
problems <electric> <utilities> faced each of the past two summers. While 
some plants were undergoing needed maintenance, some <utilities> were caught 
with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand. 
The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk <electric> prices, driving 
the price of a megawatt-hour of <electricity> in a few places from $30 to as 
high as $7,000. <Utilities> enforced rotating blackouts on customers, asked 
consumers to reduce <electric> use and passed on surcharges for the higher 
cost of <electricity>.
Hoping to avoid outages this summer, the Department of Energy has scheduled 
four regional ""summits"" on <electric> <reliability> on April 24 and 28.
Jim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison <Electric> Institute, said a third 
consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases 
could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill. ""It might push this 
thing up further on the congressional radar screen,"" although a law enacted 
immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and <transmission> 
reliability, he said.
Other thorny issues include:
? How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned <utilities>, <electric
> cooperatives and municipal <utilities>, and whether <utilities> should 
voluntarily join, or be forced to join, ""regional <transmission> 
organizations"" designed to allow more efficient transfer of <electricity> 
across the national grid.
? Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the 
interstate <transmission> of <electric> <power>. Some stakeholders argue 
federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from 
protecting its customers at the expense of others.
? Environmental groups' desire for stronger anti-pollution restrictions on <
utilities> that produce pollutants while generating <electricity>. And labor 
groups, wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through 
corporate mergers and acquisitions, want to make sure their union members are 
protected.
